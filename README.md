Simple YouTube Downloader & Subtitle Generator

This is a simple personal project I made to download videos (mainly from YouTube) and generate subtitles.
It was mostly used for Japanese content.
Features

 Download videos using yt_dlp
 Generate subtitles using Faster-Whisper
 GUI built with Tkinter
 Supports both YouTube links and local video files

Notes
 WhisperX does not work, so this project uses Faster-Whisper instead.
 The code is probably messy and not optimized.
 I don’t plan to update or improve it.
 If you want to copy, change, or reuse any part of this project go ahead. I won’t sue anyone.
